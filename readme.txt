This is a simple framework you can use for developing and testing
your threejs framework. To use the framework, run mikesGetThreejs1.html
in a browser and include the address of your program as a query string
under the 'load' parameter. For example: 

mikesGetThreejs1.html?load=js/colorCubeMatrix075.js

You can add your programs to the js folder and run them; you can also 
add javascript programs to the other folders as well.

Programs that require resources may not run from your file system
due to permission restrictions.
An example is openPyramidText.js which requires a font resource in 
the fonts directory. To run ALL programs, you either relax restrictions
in the browser you're using or run your files from a local web server.

The programs included in the js folder come from my blog site

http://whitesapphires.blogspot.com

However, the programs on this blog site are written to the threejs API
standard from late 2014, whereas the programs included in the present 
archive are based on threejs r89, released December 18, 2017. There
is not very much difference between these two standards; in fact,
one of the bigger differences is that fonts are handled as a general
resource in the newer standard. I recommend that you use the current
threejs standard for this course.
